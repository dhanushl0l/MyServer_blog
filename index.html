        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>My-Server</strong> is a lightweight, self-hosted server that enables seamless data synchronization
            across all your devices—be it Windows, Linux, or Android. Whether you are looking to sync files, manage
            notifications, clipboard data, or even SMS, My-Server handles it all.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the simplicity of Docker but designed for users of all technical levels, My-Server allows you to
            run your own server on anything from a local network to the cloud, ensuring total privacy and control over
            your data.</p>

        <h2>Why Device Sync Matters</h2>
        <p>Every day, we use multiple devices—phones, tablets, laptops—and keeping them in sync can be frustrating.
            <strong>My-Server</strong> solves this challenge by providing a universal sync platform:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>No more missed notifications: Manage calls, SMS, and notifications across all devices.</li>
            <li>Unified clipboard: Copy text on one device, paste it on another.</li>
            <li>Seamless file sync: Update documents across all your platforms instantly.</li>
            <li>Password & search sync: Keep your data available on all devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File Sync:</strong> Keep your files updated across all devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Notification Sync:</strong> Sync notifications across devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Clipboard Sync:</strong> Instant clipboard sync between devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Phone & SMS Management:</strong> Manage calls and messages from any device.</li>
            <li><strong>Password and Search Sync:</strong> Access your saved data on all platforms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p><strong>Client-side Encryption:</strong> All data sent to the server is encrypted client-side, ensuring
            privacy. Decryption happens locally, giving you full control over your sensitive information.</p>
        <p><strong>Server Flexibility:</strong> While the current implementation uses a Flask server, this could be
            replaced by another backend in the future. Our primary focus is flexibility and user control.</p>
        <p><strong>Rust Apps:</strong> The core apps are written in
            <strong>Rust</strong>, known for its performance and safety. Each app is designed to run efficiently across
            all platforms.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python/Flask:</strong> The server backend (optional if using another backend in the future).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> You can host a Flask app on a PC, an old laptop, an EC2 server, or any cloud
                server, such as PythonAnywhere.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p><strong>Current Developments:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clipboard Sync App</strong> (Rust): First module for syncing clipboard across devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Figma Mobile App Design</strong>: Initial designs for the mobile app are completed. <a

        </ul>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>All data is encrypted on the client-side before transmission, ensuring that the server only handles storing
            data. Decryption is handled by client to maintain security.</p>
